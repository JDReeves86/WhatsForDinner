# WhatsForDinner

Description

I am sure that all of us can relate to the fact that deciding what to eat for dinner can be challenging at times. To assist you in deciding What'sForDinner, we have developed an application that you may use. It is simple to use and only requires a click of a button to either generate a meal and/or drink recipe.
- Upon clicking the 'Lets Eat' button, a random meal will be generated and the following information will be displayed:

    - name of the recipe
    - an embedded URL link inside of the image that, if you choose to click, will open a tab and redirect you to a different website where the recipe is available
    - previous meals that were generated before that are accessible by clicking on them
    
- Upon clicking the 'Lets Get Drunk' button, a random drink will be generated and the following information will be displayed:

    - name of the recipe
    - an image of the drink, followed by the ingredients and recipe
    - similar to the meal generator, the previous generated drinks will also be displayed as buttons underneath that are accessible by clicking on them
    
- Technology used to build the application:

    - HTML
    - CSS
    - Javascript
    - Bulma (CSS Framework)
    - Google Fonts API
    - jQuery 
    - TheMealDB API
    - TheCocktailDB API
